If this is your first time using a Jupyter notebook you might want to go through the Db2 Data Management Console Hands on Lab at www.ibm.biz/DMCDemosPOT. It includes an introduction to using Jupyter notebooks with the Db2 family. The introduction shows you some of the basics of using a notebook, including how to create the cells, run code, and save files for future use. \n",

    "Jupyter notebooks are based on IPython which started in development in the 2006/7 timeframe. The existing Python interpreter was limited in functionality and work was started to create a richer development environment. By 2011 the development efforts resulted in IPython being released (http://blog.fperez.org/2012/01/ipython-notebook-historical.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks were a spinoff (2014) from the original IPython project. IPython continues to be the kernel that Jupyter runs on, but the notebooks are now a project on their own.\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks run in a browser and communicate to the backend IPython server which renders this content. These notebooks are used extensively by data scientists and anyone wanting to document, plot, and execute their code in an interactive environment.

    "### What is Caching\n",
    "Data Virtualization can make tables on remote data sources look, act and feel like data in a local table. The Data Virtualization engine acts as a single database that contains data from remote tables on remote data source. However, the data is not stored in the Data Virtualization Database. When you submit a query, it is analyzed by the Data Virtualization optimizer. The statement is rewritten and decomposed into parts or branches and data is retreived from each remote data source as required. Each time you run a query, you receive the latest data from the remote data servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your remote data servers are responsive, this may perform very fast, even when you are joining data from different sources together in the data virtualizaton engine. Data Virtualization will minimize the volume of data that needs to be retrieved from each remote source to optimize performance. It pushes down predicates, for example WHERE AIRCRAFT='737' from the original query to the remote data server.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have to retrieve large data sets from the remote servers, caching can dramatically improve performanmce and reduce the load on the remote data servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a cache by defining a query against the data virtualiztion server. The results of that query (the rows returned) are stored in a fast local storage system. The next time you run that query, the data virtualization engine uses the locally cached data and avoids fetching data from the remote data servers. The rows that are returned are accurate to the time that the cache was created. You can refresh the data in the cache whenever you need to or set a refresh interval and it is automnatically refreshed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of caching is that a statement doesn't have to be exactly like your cache definition for the cache to be used. The data virtualizaiton optimizer looks for caches that contain the required data and uses them when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on lab explores the difference between no using a cache, using a cache and using caches focuses on targetted data sets to optimize performance and minimize cache size and refresh requirements.\n",
